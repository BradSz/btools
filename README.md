# btools
Home grown development tools

# Rationale
This is a set of development tools that I have written and/or rewritten on various projects over the years.
This repository serves as an attempt to create the best versions of those tools, compiled and unit tested.

# Installation
To use, first install `rust`/`cargo`. Afterwards, clone and install as necessary.

For convenience, a `Makefile` is provided to install all utilities simultaneously.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradSz/btools.git
cd btools
make install
```
